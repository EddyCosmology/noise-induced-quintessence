**"Noise-Induced Transitions in Quintessence-Like Dark Energy: Sensitivity to Stochastic Vacuum Fluctuations"**  
Author: Micah David Thornton  
Draft version: February 2026  

Companion to: Thornton (2026), "A Phenomenological Model for Evolving Dark Energy Inspired by DESI DR2" (https://eddycosmology/eddy-de-collapse)

## Overview

This work presents large-scale numerical ensembles (50,000 realizations per noise strength σ) exploring how multiplicative stochastic noise affects late-time dark energy behavior in a scalar field model with nonlinear advection, hyperdiffusion, and running vacuum.  

Key findings:
- At low noise (σ ≲ 0.02), the field remains frozen near w ≈ -1 (Λ-like).
- At moderate noise (σ ≈ 0.05), w(0) shifts to \~ -0.85 (quintessence-like, consistent with DESI DR2 hints).
- At higher noise (σ ≳ 0.1), mean w(0) becomes positive → loss of acceleration.
- Parameter tuning (reduced β, increased κ) extends the viable acceleration window.

The transition reveals a critical noise threshold (σ_c ≈ 0.06 in tuned case) that constrains vacuum fluctuation amplitudes cosmologically.
